##  What I Learned

- **Longer passwords** are more secure, especially with symbols and numbers.
- Avoid personal info (names, dates), common words, and predictable patterns.
- Online tools show realistic cracking estimates using brute-force simulations.
- Using a **password manager** is safer than trying to remember complex ones.

##  Types of Attacks on Passwords

| Attack Type       | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Brute-force       | Tries every combination                           |
| Dictionary Attack | Tries common words or leaked passwords            |
| Phishing          | Tricks users into entering their passwords        |
| Keylogging        | Captures what you type using malware              |

##  Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12+ characters**
- Mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols**
- Avoid **names, birth years, dictionary words**
- Use **unique passwords** for each site
- Consider using a **passphrase** like: `GreenCat!Runs7Fast`
- Use a **password manager** like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass
